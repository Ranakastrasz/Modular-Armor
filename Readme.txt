Modular Armor Revamp.

This mod tweaks and rebalances pretty much everything connected to modular armor.


Generators
-Solar Panel
    Basic solar panel. Far cheaper, using a single solar panel, a few steel, and a few advanced circuits. Produces 75 kW and takes up 3x1 space.
    Cheaper and more powerful than before.
	Larger, making it harder to fit. Long and flat.
	
-Solar Panel Mk2
    Advanced Solar panel. Takes 20 Basic Solar Panels and 10 processing units. Produces 300 kW and takes up 5x2 space.
    More efficient, but somewhat harder to fit. Somewhat more powerful than a Burner generator during the day.
	
	TEMPERARALLY DISABLED
    Transfers power from your energy network. Cannot get power at night from accumulators (due to game limitation)
    Can transfer 40kW, takes up 1x1 space. Highly space efficient, but doesn't work outside your base, or outside a power field.
	
-Superconductor Conduit 
	TEMPERARALLY DISABLED
    Transfers power from your energy network.
    Can transfer 720kW, takes up 3x3 space. Far more poweful and effcient, but far larger and expensive. Competitive with Fusion Reactors.
	
	
-Burner
    Basic fuel-powered generator. Uses engines, steel, and advanced circuits to fabricate.
    Consumes Chemical fuel to Run. Produces 100 kW, takes up 2x2 space. Miniaturization  results in only 20% efficient, consuming solid fuel (25 MW) in 50 seconds instead of 4 minutes.
    Produces more power compared to solar panels, but uses up fuel.
	Fuel is easily available via cutting down trees.
	
-Semiconductor Conduit
    
-Fission (Fusion)
    Advanced fuel-powered generator. Produces 0.96mW of power, or 960kW using Reactor Fuel
    Highly efficient. 4x4. Only 5% efficiency, due to lack of bulky supporting infrastructure.
	As a result, Fuel with a 8gW only provide 400 kW, lasting just under 7 minutes, instead of the 2 hours and 30 minutes it would otherwise be. 
    Uses a large number of shield generators in it's construction for the containment field.


Utility
-Basic Actuator Equipment
    Lower tier exoskeleton equipment.
    25 kw for 5% speed boost.  1x2
    Cheaper and earlier available. More energy efficient, but less space efficient.
    Easy to fit in any armor.
-Advanced Actuator Equipment
    Renamed Basic Exoskeleton equipment.
    200 kw for 30% speed boost, 2x4
    
Shield
-Basic shield generator
    5 Capacity, uses 10kj/shield point.
    Cheap, 1x1, high efficiency, tiny capacity, slow recharge.
	Adequate defence vs early game worms and spitters, but cannot handle sustained fire.
	Easy to place.
-Shield Generator
    Same as current shield generator
    Uses 10 basic shields, red circuits, steel, and some superconducting coil to produce.
-Shield Generator Mk2
    Similar to old one, all stats scaled up ~2.25.
	3x3 in size as well, which is also 2.25x larger.
	Harder to fit, but much more impressive.
	
Armor
-Heavy
	Requires Light armor, 10 less steel.
	
-Modular
	Requires Heavy Armor instead of steel
-Power Armor
	Requires Modular Armor instead of steel
	Requires 10 speed modules.
-Power Armor Mk2
	Requires Power Armor instead of steel
	Requires 10 Mk2 Modules instead of 5 Mk3
	Requires 50 Engine Units
	
-Power Armor Mk3
	-Higher Tier Armor.
	Easily an Order of Magnitude more expensive, in exchange for
		44% more capacity. Well worth the price however.
