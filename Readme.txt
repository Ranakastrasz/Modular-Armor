Modular Armor Revamp.

This mod tweaks and rebalances pretty much everything connected to modular armor.

Simple changes
-All armor is fabricated used the previous tier of armor.
-Basic Modular armor can be produced without blue circuits, allowing it to be created earlier.
All power production and consumption values increased 10x. This is mainly to ensure additional compatibility between both power networks. Personal Roboport is easier to power as a side effect.

A lot of the more advanced equipment requires Alien artefacts to research and fabricate. some of it uses alien instead of blue science.
Alien artefacts are generally used in the form of Superconducting Coils. 
Generators
-Solar
    Basic solar panel. Far cheaper, using a single solar panel, a few steel, and a few advanced circuits. Produces 15 kW.
    Cheaper and more powerful than before.
-Solar 2
    Advanced Solar panel. Takes 20 Basic Solar Panels and 10 processing units. Produces 200 kW and takes up 3x3 space.
    More efficient, but somewhat harder to fit.
-Burner
    Basic fuel-powered generator. Uses engines, steel, and advanced circuits to fabricate.
    Consumes Solid fuel, coal, or raw wood to run. Produces 100 kW, takes up 2x2 space.
    Produces a significant amounts of power compared to solar panels, but uses up fuel.
-Conduit
    Transfers power from your energy network. Cannot get power at night from accumulators (due to game limitation)
    Can transfer 50kW, takes up 1x1 space. Highly space efficient, but doesn't work outside your base, or outside a power field.
    
-Fusion
    Advanced fuel-powered generator. Produces 1mW of power, or 1000kW. To do so, it consumes Alien Fuel, which is Solid fuel infused with Alien Artefacts.
    Highly efficient. 4x4. Without fuel, it still produces 100kW, but that puts it at around the level of a Solar generator.
    Uses a large number of shield generators in it's construction for the containment field.

Fuel Powered generators consume fuel directly from the main inventory. Currently, there is no indicator for current fuel levels, or that you have run out.

Utility
-Basic Actuator Equipment
    Lower tier exoskeleton equipment.
    25 kw for 5% speed boost.  1x2
    Cheaper and earlier available. More energy efficient, but less space efficient.
    Easier to fit in lower tier armor however.
-Advanced Actuator Equipment
    Renamed Basic Exoskeleton equipment.
    200 kw for 30% speed boost, 2x4
    
Shield
-Basic shield generator
    5 Capacity, uses 50kj/shield point.
    Cheap, 1x1. Doesn't require any superconducting coils.
-Shield Generator
    Same as current shield generator
    Uses 10 basic shields, red circuits, steel, and some superconducting coil to produce.
-Shield Generator Mk2
    Similar to old one, but 3x3 in size, and ~ 2.25x as strong.
    
Weapon
-Laser Turret
    Damage increased from 5/shot to 20/shot, Energy consumption remains unchanged.
    This might make this a viable module.

-Discharge defence.
    Damage increase from 30/shot to 240/shot, doubled cooldown. Energy consumption unchanged.
    This isn't quite enough to obliterate Big biters, but will certainly melt anything less.
